# Profile Picture Setup

## Add Your Profile Picture

To display your profile picture on the resume:

1. **Add your photo**: Place your profile picture in this directory as `me.png`
   - Recommended size: 240x240 pixels or larger (will be automatically resized)
   - Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG
   - For best results, use a square photo

2. **Alternative formats**: If you have a different format, rename your file to:
   - `me.jpg` or `me.jpeg` for JPEG files
   - Update the src in `index.html` if needed

3. **Placeholder**: If no image is provided, a stylized "B" placeholder will be shown automatically

## Additional Images

For the header background, you can add `header-background.jpg` to create a custom background.

## Quick Setup
```bash
# Copy your profile picture to this directory
# Rename it to me.png for automatic detection
```

The website will automatically detect and display your profile picture once added!
- Header background: 1920x1080px (landscape)

You can also add a favicon.png in the frontend root directory.
